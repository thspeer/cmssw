This file is not used anymore to build the minimumbias data external!
Now the correct procedure is to update the list directly in data-FastSimulation-PileUpProducer.spec (in the CMSDIST repository) and to inform the release managers to rebuild data-FastSimulation-PileUpProducer external via a pull request. 

You have to fork the CMSDIST repository, clone it locally, modify the file data-FastSimulation-PileUpProducer.spec, push it in your forked repository, and make a pull request.
